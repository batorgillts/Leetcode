# Solutions on Lists, Arrays, and Sorting

### Two_Sum_II
In this problem, Since we are already sorted we can use 2 approaches from right hand side and from the left hand side.

Since the left side is the smaller number we could first check our right hand side. To do so we need to check the sum if it is bigger than target right hand side will get shifted to the left and on the other hand if it is smaller than target we could shift left hand side to the next value stored in the vector.

### Product of array
In this case we have solved the problem by approaching from the desired index value by dividing it into 2 sides and we could approach the probleb by having 2 traversing loops from left to right and from left to right.

### Sort Colors
For this problem since we know we only have 3 types of value in the vector we could directly check it.

If the number is 2 we could basically swap with the right most and if it is 0 we could left most side. By keep on doing this we could achieve our desired approach.
